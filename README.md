## Description

This card displays animated weather radar loops within Home Assistant. It supports multiple radar data sources and map styles, and can be zoomed and panned seamlessly. Markers, hazard overlays (US wildfires + NWS watches & warnings), real-time lightning, a forecast nowcast (DWD), opt-in [motion-compensated playback](https://github.com/jpettitt/weather-radar-card/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#motion-compensation) (rain drifts between frames instead of teleporting), adjustable playback speed with optional per-user persistence, full sections-grid resize support, and 11 languages.

## What's new in 3.9 (current stable)

CARTO began requiring an API key to avoid a watermark on their free basemap tiles (Light/Voyager/Dark/Satellite) — this release adds an option to remove it, plus two new basemap styles that never need a key at all.

- **`carto_api_key` config option** — free CARTO API key (no account needed — [carto.com/basemaps/apikey](https://carto.com/basemaps/apikey/)) removes the watermark. Set it in the editor's Map section or via YAML; leaving it unset keeps the previous (watermarked but working) tiles.
- **Two new no-key map styles: `Grey` and `GreyDark`** — Esri Light/Dark Grey Canvas basemaps, for anyone who'd rather not sign up for a CARTO key at all.

For the full release history see [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/jpettitt/weather-radar-card/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## What's new in 3.8

- **Themeable progress-bar colors** — `progress_bar_background_color`, `progress_bar_active_color`, and `progress_bar_now_color` override the timeline's built-in light/dark palette via YAML, to match your dashboard theme. ([3.8.0-beta1](https://github.com/jpettitt/weather-radar-card/releases/tag/v3.8.0-beta1))
- **Timestamps follow Home Assistant's own Time format setting** — the radar timeline and NWS alert times defer to your HA profile's 12h/24h preference (Settings → General) instead of guessing from the browser locale. ([3.8.0-beta1](https://github.com/jpettitt/weather-radar-card/releases/tag/v3.8.0-beta1))
- **Wildfire popup area and discovery date now follow your HA unit system and locale** — hectares for metric users instead of always showing NIFC's raw acres, and locale-aware date ordering. ([3.8.0-beta1](https://github.com/jpettitt/weather-radar-card/releases/tag/v3.8.0-beta1))
- **Forecast-heavy configs no longer load the farthest-future frame before "now"** — for a config like `past_minutes: 0, forecast_minutes: 60`, the initial load now always starts at "now" and fans outward, instead of loading highest-index-first. ([3.8.0-beta2](https://github.com/jpettitt/weather-radar-card/releases/tag/v3.8.0-beta2))
- **Fixed a periodic-refresh race that could corrupt playback position** — the timeline drifting backward on loop, or skip-back jumping to "Latest" instead of the previous frame. ([3.8.0-beta3](https://github.com/jpettitt/weather-radar-card/releases/tag/v3.8.0-beta3))

## Roadmap

Active threads, no specific version commitment — with 3.9 shipped, these target 3.10 or later. See [docs/todo.md](https://github.com/jpettitt/weather-radar-card/blob/main/docs/todo.md) for the full backlog with status per item.

- **Real-time per-user layer visibility control panel** — UI for toggling individual overlays in real time. Persistence framework already shipped (3.6.5); first consumer shipped (playback speed in 3.7.0-alpha1); the on-map panel itself is the remaining piece. Full design in [docs/layer-control-design.md](https://github.com/jpettitt/weather-radar-card/blob/main/docs/layer-control-design.md).
- **Additional wind sources** — Open-Meteo for global coverage, ICON pressure levels for upper-air wind, regional finer-than-ICON-D2 sources (AROME, MEPS, HRRR). Tiers and trade-offs documented in [docs/todo.md](https://github.com/jpettitt/weather-radar-card/blob/main/docs/todo.md).

## Install

### HACS

The card is part of the default HACS store. To install the latest stable, search for "Weather Radar Card" in HACS → Frontend → Explore & Add Repositories. Toggle **Show beta versions** in HACS to opt into prereleases.

### Manual

Download the files from the [latest release](https://github.com/jpettitt/weather-radar-card/releases) and place them in `www/community/weather-radar-card` in your HA `config` directory:

```text
└── configuration.yaml
└── www
    └── community
        └── weather-radar-card
            └── weather-radar-card.js
            └── home-circle-dark.svg
            └── home-circle-light.svg
            └── pause.png
            └── play.png
            └── preview.jpg
            └── radar-colour-bar-dwd.png
            └── radar-colour-bar-nws.png
            └── radar-colour-bar-universalblue.png
            └── recenter.png
            └── skip-back.png
            └── skip-next.png
```

> **Upgrading from v2?** Delete `leaflet.js`, `leaflet.css`, `leaflet.toolbar.min.js`, and `leaflet.toolbar.min.css` from `www/community/weather-radar-card/` — they are bundled into `weather-radar-card.js` in v3 and the old files are no longer used.

Then add the following to your Lovelace resources:

```yaml
resources:
  - url: /local/community/weather-radar-card/weather-radar-card.js
    type: module
```

## Minimal config

```yaml
type: 'custom:weather-radar-card'
```

That's it. The card defaults to RainViewer, your HA instance's location, and a `zone.home` marker. From there, the GUI editor exposes every knob — see [Configuration](https://github.com/jpettitt/weather-radar-card/blob/main/docs/configuration.md) for the full reference and [Examples](https://github.com/jpettitt/weather-radar-card/blob/main/docs/examples.md) for common starting points.

For touchscreen dashboards, YAML can enlarge the timeline scrub target upward over the lower map while preserving its slim visual track and original bottom-bar height:

```yaml
show_progress_bar: true
progress_bar_touch_height: 44
```

## Sizing

How tall the card renders depends on where it lives:

- **Masonry / panel views, or a sections cell with `rows: auto`** — the card uses the `height:` config option (default `400px`). This is the normal case.
- **A sections-grid cell with a fixed row count** (you've dragged the resize handle, or `rows:` is a number) — **the grid cell owns the height.** The card fills the cell and the `height:` option is ignored; resize it with the cell's drag handle instead. The editor disables the height box in this case so it's clear which control is in charge.

In other words: `rows: auto` → `height:` applies; `rows: <number>` → the cell's height applies. See [sections-grid behaviour](https://github.com/jpettitt/weather-radar-card/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#sections-grid-support) for details.
