## [Unreleased]

## [3.5.0-alpha2] - 2026-05-03

> Animation polish on top of `3.5.0-alpha`.

### Added

- **`smooth_overlap` config knob (0–1)** — tunable crossfade overlap when `smooth_animation: true`. `0` = sequential (no brightness dip; cushion held), `0.5` = 50% overlap, `1` = fully simultaneous (default; brief mid-transition dip). Fade duration auto-calibrates so the full cycle still equals `frame_delay` regardless of overlap. Exposed in the editor as a 0–1 slider.
- **Editor mutual gating for animation timing** — `transition_time` is disabled when Smooth Animation is on (the smooth path computes its own fade); `smooth_overlap` is disabled when Smooth Animation is off. Both fields stay visible so the relationship is obvious.

### Fixed

- **Trail on first cycle after editing animation settings.** Changing animation settings used to leave stale CSS-transition state on the radar layers, producing a visible trail on the first cycle after the change. setConfig now does a full teardown + reinit on any structural config change. Exception: when the user pans/zooms the live map in editor mode, the back-propagated `center_latitude` / `center_longitude` / `zoom_level` keys are diffed and skipped — a teardown there would interrupt the user's active interaction. Direct YAML edits to those keys still move the map (via `setView`), guarded against re-firing as a back-prop bounce.

### Localization

11 language files updated for the new `smooth_overlap` editor strings.

## [3.5.0-alpha] - 2026-05-03

> First alpha cut from the `nws-alerts` branch. Layered on top of
> `3.4.0-beta` (DWD radar + crossfade fix). **US-only data** in the new
> overlays — see the strong life-safety disclaimers in the README.

### Added

- **Wildfire perimeter overlay** (US-only) — `show_wildfires: true` overlays active US wildfire perimeters from NIFC's [WFIGS Current Interagency Fire Perimeters](https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/nifc::wfigs-current-interagency-fire-perimeters/about) feed. Active fires draw red, fully-contained ones grey. Small incidents render as a fire icon at the centroid; larger ones as a polygon outline. Click any fire for a popup with name, acreage, containment %, discovery date, and a link to NIFC's InciWeb (gated against InciWeb's RSS index so we don't link to 404s). Adaptive 5/30-minute refresh. Filter knobs: `wildfire_min_acres` (default 10), `wildfire_radius_km`, plus colour / fill / refresh overrides.
- **NWS watches & warnings overlay** (US-only) — `show_alerts: true` overlays active US National Weather Service watches and warnings from `api.weather.gov/alerts/active`. Alerts render as translucent polygons coloured per [NWS's standard warning palette](https://www.weather.gov/help-map). Both polygon-bearing and zone-based alerts render: zone shapes are fetched on-demand from `api.weather.gov/zones/...` and cached in localStorage (TTL 30 days, versioned key prefix `wrc-zone-v1:`) so they're zero-network on subsequent sessions. Click any alert for a popup with event, headline, severity / certainty / urgency, effective and expiry windows, full description (preserves NWS's line breaks), and a link to weather.gov.
- **Hazard Overlays editor subpage** — new top-level "Markers and Overlays" section in the editor groups two nav rows: **Markers** (the existing list) and **Hazard Overlays** (new). The Hazard Overlays subpage exposes the wildfire and alerts toggles, their per-overlay knobs (min_acres, radius_km, min_severity), and a 2-column grid of NWS alert-category checkboxes (Tornado, Thunderstorm, Flood, Winter, Tropical, Fire Weather, Heat, Wind, Marine, Other; marine off by default).
- **Build timestamp in console signon** — the card's startup signon now reads `WEATHER-RADAR-CARD Version X.Y.Z (built YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC)` so users can confirm a hard refresh actually loaded the new bundle vs a cached older one. Injected by a tiny inline rollup plugin.
- **Region-warning utility** — surfaces a banner when any US-only feature (wildfires, alerts, NOAA radar) is enabled with `hass.config.country !== 'US'`. Multiple US-only features collapse into a single combined banner instead of stacking.

### Changed

- **WYSIWYG map editing** — when this card's edit dialog is open, every pan/zoom in the live map auto-propagates to the editor's Lat/Long/Zoom fields in real time. The "Save as map center" button is removed entirely. Detection via window-level events from the editor element's connect/disconnect lifecycle (so the auto-propagate is OFF when only the dashboard is in edit mode but no card editor is open — fixes a pre-existing bug where the save button was visible in that state).
- **Toggle layout standardised** — every `<label>` switch now renders as `[switch] [text]` left-aligned with a gap. Single source of truth.
- **Per-source rate limiters are now module-level singletons** — survive card teardown (config edits no longer reset the count) and shared across multiple weather-radar-cards on the same dashboard.
- **Pause when hidden** — wildfire and NWS-alerts layers stop their refresh timers when the card scrolls off-screen or the tab is hidden, and refetch on resume if the pause was longer than the visible-refresh interval. Radar player already paused itself.
- **Dynamic radar tile size** — picks 256/512/1024/2048 from `map.getSize()` so panel-view / fullscreen maps load with bigger tiles (fewer requests for the same coverage). All three radar sources support this. **Confirmed empirically to noticeably cut load time and rate-limit hits on larger maps.**

### Fixed

- **Bug — alerts_categories: [] now correctly hides everything.** Previously an explicit empty array fell back to the default category set, so unchecking every category in the editor reverted to "show everything". New `getActiveAlertCategories(configured)` helper distinguishes `undefined` (use defaults) from `[]` (none).
- **Bug — popup `[wildfire]` race during zone resolution.** `_zoneFetches` could be left with stale entries on localStorage cache hits because the function returned synchronously before the caller registered it. Refactored so `_fetchZone` self-registers as its first action, eliminating the order-of-operations bug.
- **Popup accent colour uses WCAG-style relative luminance** — replaces a hardcoded list of "light" hex values, so any future palette additions get the right text colour automatically.

### Localization

11 language files updated for the new editor strings (Hazard Overlays subpage, alert categories, severity levels, region warnings, popup labels). Coverage 92–99% per language; brand acronyms (NWS, NOAA, NIFC, README) and the "Acres" US unit intentionally retained in source form.

### Tests

128 → 223 unit tests (95 added). New coverage: geo helpers (centroid, haversine, bbox), string helpers (escapeHtml XSS injection patterns, slugify, truncate), NWS alert categories (regression guard for the empty-array bug), NWS alert colour table, region-warning composition, alert-layer helpers (featureKey, decisionsEqual including zone-arrival diff, severity-sort, luminance, formatDateTime, localStorage zone cache round-trip + TTL eviction + corrupt JSON + quota-exceeded handling). Pure-helper extraction (`src/geo-utils.ts`, `src/string-utils.ts`) deduplicates code that was previously identical between the wildfire and alerts layers.

## [3.4.0-beta] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- **DWD radar source** — `data_source: DWD` uses Deutscher Wetterdienst's `Niederschlagsradar` WMS at `maps.dwd.de`. 5-minute frame steps (vs. RainViewer's public 10-minute tier), ~3 days of history, +2 hours of forecast available via the `Radar_*-product_*` layers. Coverage is the German radar network footprint (Germany + immediate neighbours).
- **`dwd_layer` config option** — DWD-only WMS layer name override. Default `Niederschlagsradar` (mm/h). Set to `Radar_wn-product_1x1km_ger` for reflectivity (dBZ) with 2-hour nowcast frames included.
- **`dwd_time_override` config option** — DWD-only ISO timestamp to anchor frames at a fixed point in time instead of "now". Useful for verifying the overlay renders when current weather is dry.
- **`dwd_forecast_hours` config option** — DWD-only. Includes this many hours of nowcast forecast in the playback range as if they were "current". When set to a positive value the layer auto-switches from `Niederschlagsradar` to `Radar_wn-product_1x1km_ger` (which carries the +2h nowcast frames) unless `dwd_layer` explicitly overrides it. Matches the DWD WarnWetter app's default behaviour.
- **DWD-coloured colour bar** — `data_source: DWD` shows a horizontal strip using DWD's `Niederschlagsradar` palette (15 bands sampled from DWD's official legend), replacing the misleading universal-blue scale used as a fallback before. Same UI shape as the existing NOAA / RainViewer bars; honours `show_color_bar: false`.
- **DWD coverage check** — `data_source: DWD` emits a one-shot `console.warn` when HA's configured location falls outside the bounding box of Germany and its immediate neighbours, so the inevitable no-data grey wash isn't mistaken for a broken card.
- **`smooth_animation` config option** — when `true`, the crossfade fully spans the inter-frame interval so the radar appears to flow continuously instead of stepping. Overrides `transition_time`.

### Changed

- **DWD rate limiter raised to 500/min** (from the initial conservative 120/min, copied from NOAA). DWD's `maps.dwd.de` is fronted by Akamai with no documented per-IP limit; 120 was visibly throttling pan/zoom bursts (~80 tile requests in one move) without ever seeing 429s from the server. 500/min matches RainViewer.
- **DWD tiles requested at 512×512** instead of the default 256×256 — quarters the request count for the same map coverage. Useful for the same burst case above and reduces total bandwidth slightly since the per-tile overhead is amortised.

### Fixed

- **Crossfade no longer pulses against light basemaps.** The previous symmetric crossfade animated the outgoing layer 1→0 while the incoming layer animated 0→1. At the midpoint both layers sat at opacity 0.5 and alpha-composed to ~0.75 visibility — letting 25% of the basemap show through at every transition. Replaced with a three-layer z-stack: the new current frame gets a higher z-index, snaps to opacity 0, then animates to the configured `radar_opacity` with `ease-in-out`; the immediately-previous frame stays at full opacity underneath (so transparent pixels of the incoming frame don't briefly expose the basemap); the frame BEFORE that simultaneously fades from full opacity to 0 (so old data dissolves smoothly instead of snapping out). Older frames stay hidden throughout. At the loop boundary — when the player wraps from the last frame back to the first after the restart pause — transitions snap instead of fading, since the natural pause makes a smooth fade across the loop read as "time ran backwards".
- **Internal options no longer leak into WMS GetMap URLs.** `FetchWmsTileLayer` was passing its full options object to Leaflet's `L.TileLayer.WMS.initialize`, which appends any unrecognised option as a query parameter — so requests carried `&rateLimiter=[object%20Object]&on429=...&animationOwnsOpacity=true` tail-end, which were ignored by the server but bloated the URL and confused log inspection. Now strips those internal fields before delegating, then re-attaches them to `this.options` for the rest of the layer code. Affects both NOAA and DWD WMS layers.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **Editor localization** — every label, helper, dropdown option, and banner string in the editor and runtime UI now resolves through `localize()`. Existing translations updated for Norwegian Bokmål (nb) and Slovak (sk); new translations added for German (de), French (fr), Dutch (nl), Spanish (es), Italian (it), Polish (pl), Swedish (sv), and Portuguese-Brazilian (pt-BR). Translations are best-effort and welcome native-speaker review.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **`radar_opacity` config option** — adjust the opacity of the active radar frame (0.1–1.0, default `1.0`). Lower values let more of the basemap show through. Editor exposes a slider in the Appearance section.

## [3.1.3] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- **Markers disappeared when clustering was on** (#110). The map's `maxZoom` bump from 10 to 16 in 3.1.2 expanded markercluster's internal cluster tree by six zoom levels, exposing a markercluster bug where a cluster's `_bounds` could end up undefined and crash `_zoomEnd` (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'lat')`). The crash left the marker pane completely empty. Setting `disableClusteringAtZoom: 11` on the cluster group caps the cluster tree depth — beyond zoom 11 markers display individually anyway, so there's no behavioural cost.

## [3.1.2] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Map `maxZoom` raised from 10 to 16. Basemaps will sharpen up to their native resolution; the radar overlay (capped at `maxNativeZoom: 7`) will upscale and look pixelated past zoom 7. User-requested tradeoff.
- Cluster badge count fix (3.1.1) now applies to **all** `zone.*` markers, not just `zone.home`. A cluster with `zone.work + 3 device_trackers` shows badge `3`. The cluster icon is rendered from the user-configured icon on the representative zone marker (preferring `zone.home` if present, otherwise the first zone in the cluster), falling back to `mdi:home` / `mdi:map-marker-radius` when no icon is set.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-04-27

### Changed (build / release)

- **`dist/weather-radar-card.js.gz` is no longer tracked on feature branches.** Each branch CI was independently rebuilding the gzipped artefact, causing binary merge conflicts on every PR. The `.gz` is now regenerated by CI on push to `master` (so master always has a fresh one matching the served `.js`) **and** by the release workflow on `release: published` (which uploads `.js` + `.gz` as release assets). HACS picks up the assets directly, so existing installs always overwrite their stale `.gz` on update.

### Changed

- Footer / progress bar / links now use HA theme CSS variables (`--card-background-color`, `--primary-text-color`, `--primary-color`) — custom themes are picked up automatically. The previous hard-coded two-tone scheme is gone.
- `map_style: auto` follows `hass.themes.darkMode` (so the map matches HA's dark-mode setting whether the user picks it manually or has HA follow the browser); falls back to OS `prefers-color-scheme` only when HA hasn't exposed a value. The map rebuilds automatically when the flag flips.

### Fixed

- Home cluster badge now counts only non-home markers (e.g. home + 3 others shows `3`, not `4`). Badge is hidden entirely when a cluster contains only home markers.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-04-26

Multi-marker overhaul. **Breaking:** single-marker config fields (`show_marker`, `marker_latitude`, `marker_longitude`, `marker_icon`, `marker_icon_entity`, `mobile_marker_*`) are deprecated. Existing YAML auto-migrates in memory on load with a console warning; the editor only writes the new `markers[]` format.

### Added

- **Multi-marker support** — `markers[]` array replaces the old single-marker fields. Each entry supports `entity`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `icon`, `icon_entity`, `color`, `track`, and `mobile_only`.
- **Live entity tracking** — markers with an `entity` field update their position on every HA state change. Works with `device_tracker.*`, `person.*`, `zone.*`, or any entity with `latitude`/`longitude` attributes.
- **Track resolution** — set `track: entity` or `track: true` on a marker to auto-centre the map. Priority: (1) `track: entity` on a `person.*` whose `user_id` matches the logged-in HA user, (2) `track: entity` on any other entity, (3) `track: true`. The tracking winner always renders on top (`zIndexOffset: 1000`).
- **Default home marker** — when `markers` is absent, the card auto-creates a single `zone.home` marker. `markers: []` opts out.
- **Auto-migration** — old single-marker fields are converted to `markers[]` in memory on load; existing YAML continues to work.
- **Marker clustering** (`cluster_markers`, default `true`) — nearby markers collapse into a count badge; tap/click to spiderfy. The tracked marker always renders outside the cluster. Home clusters render as the home icon with a small superscript count badge.
- **`mobile_only` marker flag** — a marker with `mobile_only: true` only renders on mobile devices (HA Companion app, mobile UA, or screen width ≤ 768 px). Replaces the old `mobile_marker_*` fields.
- **Any MDI icon supported** — markers render via HA's `<ha-icon>` element so any name in HA's icon database works (e.g. `mdi:car-pickup`, `mdi:rocket`). No hardcoded allow-list.
- **Icon picker autocomplete** — the editor's marker icon field uses HA's `ha-icon-picker` with full MDI autocomplete and live preview.
- **Smart icon auto-detect on entity selection** — picking an entity in the editor auto-fills the icon from `attributes.icon` → `device_class` lookup → `source_type` (device_tracker: router / bluetooth / gps) → domain default (`mdi:account`, `mdi:home`, `mdi:map-marker-radius`, `mdi:map-marker`). Person entities default to their photo when one is available.
- **Use entity picture toggle** — person markers get a dedicated switch to choose between the entity photo and an MDI icon.
- **Per-marker `color`** — CSS colour for `mdi:*` and default icons.
- **Theme-aware footer** — the footer / progress-bar chrome now follows HA's theme setting (or OS `prefers-color-scheme`), independent of map style. Re-renders automatically on theme change.
- **NWS colour bar** — `data_source: NOAA` renders the NWS reflectivity scale (`radar-colour-bar-nws.png`) instead of RainViewer's universal-blue scale.
- **Unit test suite** — 128 Vitest tests covering migration, position resolution, track priority, icon rendering, rate limiting, and mobile detection. Runs in CI on every push and PR.
- **CI builds dist for every branch** — feature branches get an auto-built bundle committed back; bundle marked `linguist-generated` so PR diffs hide it.

### Changed

- **Editor Location section** only contains map-center coordinates; marker configuration is in the new Markers section with per-marker rows.
- **Editor Mobile Overrides section removed** — use `mobile_only: true` on a marker instead.
- **Editor map-style default** — selector correctly shows `Auto` when `map_style` is unset (previously showed `Light`).
- **Production build minified** — terser added back. Bundle ~707 kB → ~278 kB; gzip ~143 kB → ~77 kB. Watch mode skipped for fast iteration.

### Removed

- **`mobile_center_*` fields** — undocumented and unused; removed entirely.
- **Editor `card_title` control** — the field was orphaned (never read anywhere).

### Fixed

- `width` config field is now applied to the card.
- `square_map: true` no longer collapses the map to zero height.
- NOAA animation playback direction (was newest → oldest).
- Colour bar `src` and visibility hoisted into the lit template — previously a rate-limit or fetch failure could leave the bar empty with no `src`.
- `map_style: Satellite` home marker now uses the light SVG (was using dark).
- Map z-index isolation, timestamp wrapping, and LitElement rendering carried forward from v3.0.2.

## [3.0.2] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- Map floating above HA navigation drawer / sidebar — added `isolation: isolate` to `:host` to cap Leaflet's z-index:1000 controls inside the card's stacking context (#95).
- Locale-aware timestamp wrapping to a second line in the bottom bar — added `white-space: nowrap`.
- Card producing no DOM after the TS target moved to ES2022 — set `useDefineForClassFields: false` so native class field semantics no longer shadow LitElement's `@property()` accessors. `moduleResolution` updated from deprecated `node` to `bundler`.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- `disable_scroll` option — disables map pan/drag (mouse and touch) while keeping pinch-to-zoom active; lets mobile users swipe through the HA dashboard without moving the map

### Fixed

- `show_scale` had no effect — the Leaflet scale control was never added to the map despite the option being present in config and the editor toggle being wired. Now correctly renders the scale bar, respecting the HA instance unit system (metric / imperial).

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- NOAA/NWS radar source — US-only experimental mode using MRMS base reflectivity via `mapservices.weather.noaa.gov`
- Show Snow option — includes or excludes snow in RainViewer precipitation tiles
- Rate-limit banner — visible indicator when the API tile quota is temporarily exhausted
- Save map center in edit mode — pan/zoom the card while editing and click the overlay button to write `center_latitude`, `center_longitude`, and `zoom_level` back to config without manually entering coordinates
- Marker icon options — `default`, `entity_picture`, and MDI icon types configurable per device (desktop / mobile)
- `show_color_bar` option — hide the RainViewer radar colour scale bar (default shown)
- `show_progress_bar` option — hide the frame timeline bar (default shown)
- `map_style: Auto` — follows OS dark/light mode via `prefers-color-scheme`; map reinitialises automatically when the system theme changes at runtime
- `double_tap_action` — configurable double-tap/double-click action: built-in shortcuts (`recenter`, `toggle_play`) or any standard HA action object (`navigate`, `call-service`, etc.)
- Scrubbable timeline — click or drag the progress bar to seek to any frame; dragging pauses playback, releasing resumes it
- Locale-aware frame timestamp — uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with the browser locale, so 12 h (AM/PM) or 24 h is chosen automatically per the user's regional settings

### Changed

- **Breaking: Leaflet is now bundled.** `leaflet.js`, `leaflet.css`, `leaflet.toolbar.min.js`, and `leaflet.toolbar.min.css` are no longer distributed as separate files — they are compiled into `weather-radar-card.js`. Delete the old files from `www/community/weather-radar-card/` when upgrading.
- **Breaking: iframe removed.** The card is now a native LitElement / Shadow DOM component. No srcdoc, no opaque origin workarounds, proper HA theming integration.
- Leaflet.Toolbar2 replaced by a native `L.Control` implementation — removes the external toolbar dependency entirely.
- Animation engine replaced: frame switching is now driven by JavaScript opacity writes with CSS `transition` for crossfades, replacing the previous CSS `@keyframes` engine. More reliable across all browsers in Shadow DOM context.
- Map auto-selects `Light` (CARTO) for English-language HA instances in light mode and `OSM` for all other languages; `map_style: Auto` extends this with dark-mode awareness.
- Marker defaults to HA home location (`hass.config.latitude/longitude`) rather than the card's `center_latitude` — changing the map center no longer moves the marker.
- Navigation settle delay reduced from 500 ms to 100 ms.

### Fixed

- Animation flash-on-load caused by duplicate `_initRadar` runs sharing the same frame generation counter
- `_updateRadar` crash when the RainViewer API returns an empty frame list
- `_updateRadar` mutations continuing after card teardown (missing generation guard)
- `once('load')` callback in `_updateRadar` running after `clear()` with no teardown guard
- `resolveCoordinate` treating coordinate `0` (equator / Prime Meridian) as falsy and substituting the fallback value
- Mobile marker icon defaulting to `entity_picture` when not explicitly configured
- `visibilitychange` listener accumulating on `document` across card reinitializations (never removed)
- Worker Blob URL never revoked on `clear()`
- Editor direct mutation of `@state` config via `delete` instead of spreading to a new object
